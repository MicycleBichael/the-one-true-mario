# Studying the Effect of Uncertainty on Reinforcement Learning With Super Mario

This is the repo for my Capstone project for MSTC.
As the name suggests, the intention of this project was to study the effect of simulated uncertainty on the results of 
reinforcement learning, using Mario for the original NES as an environment.
